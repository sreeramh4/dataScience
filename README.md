#Project_TB_SH tries to analyse dataset which consists of total population and total number of deaths due to TB (excluding HIV) in 2013 in each of the Common Wealth of Nations

The data was taken in July 2015 from http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.POP107?lang=en (population) and http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.1317?lang=en (deaths). The uncertainty bounds of the number of deaths were ignored.
