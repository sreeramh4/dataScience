#Project_TB_SH tries to analyse dataset which consists of total population and total number of deaths due to TB (excluding HIV) in 2013 in each of the Common Wealth of Nations

The data was taken in July 2015 from http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.POP107?lang=en (population) and http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.1317?lang=en (deaths). The uncertainty bounds of the number of deaths were ignored.

Project2VacationWeather deals with figuring out an ideal 2-week period to go on vacation to a BRICS capital. The Course Demo takes into account the weather in London to make the prediction and I have decided to replicate the results for Brasilia. The analysis is based on the weather data for 2014 made available by  Weather Underground (http://www.wunderground.com/history).
